# Data_Wizards
# Airline Profitability Prediction

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict airline profitability using machine learning techniques based on various operational and financial factors such as flight delays, aircraft utilization, load factor, maintenance downtime, and fuel efficiency. By leveraging historical flight data, the model provides insights that can help airlines optimize their operations and improve profitability. It provides insights into key factors affecting profitability, including aircraft utilization, maintenance downtime, fuel efficiency, revenue, and operating costs. The dashboard leverages **machine learning models and data visualization techniques** to support decision-making and enhance airline performance.

## Features ‚ú®
